# Suppose you are located at the center of a cube. If you could look all around
# you in every direction, each wall of the cube would occupy 1/6 of your field of
# vision. Suppose you move toward one of the walls so that you are now half-way
# between it and the center of the cube. What fraction of your field of vision is
# now taken up by the closest wall? This program uses a Monte Carlo simulation that 
# repeatedly "looks" in a random direction and counts how many times it sees the wall.

# each wall takes up 60 degrees of vision from the center of the cube
# 1/6 is approximately 16.67%
